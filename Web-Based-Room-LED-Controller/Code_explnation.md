# Here’s how RGB to HSV conversion works:

RGB and HSV are two different color spaces used to represent colors. RGB stands for Red Green Blue and is an additive color model used in digital displays. HSV stands for Hue Saturation Value and is a cylindrical-coordinate representation of colors.

To convert RGB values to HSV values, we first need to normalize the RGB values by dividing them by 255. This converts the range of each value from 0-255 to 0-1.

Next, we find the maximum and minimum values among the normalized RGB values. The Value (V) of the HSV color space is simply the maximum of the normalized RGB values.

The Saturation (S) of the HSV color space is calculated as follows:

S = (V - min(R, G, B)) / V
Finally, we calculate the Hue (H) of the HSV color space using the following formula:

H = 0 if V == R == G == B else \
    60 * (G - B) / (V - min(R, G, B)) if V == R != G != B else \
    60 * (B - R) / (V - min(R, G, B)) + 120 if V == G != R != B else \
    60 * (R - G) / (V - min(R, G, B)) + 240 if V == B != R != G else \
    60 * ((G - R) / (V - min(R, G, B)) + 2) if V != R != G != B else None
Where R, G, and B are the Red, Green and Blue values respectively.

Hue is the color reflected from or transmitted through an object and is measured in degrees ranging from 0 to 360. In the RGB color space, Hue is calculated based on the relative intensities of Red, Green and Blue.

The formula for calculating Hue depends on which of the Red, Green or Blue values is the maximum value (V) and which is the minimum value (m). If R is the maximum value and B is the minimum value, then Hue (H) is calculated as follows:

H = 60 * (G - B) / (V - m)
If G is the maximum value and B is the minimum value, then Hue (H) is calculated as follows:

H = 60 * (B - R) / (V - m) + 120
If B is the maximum value and R is the minimum value, then Hue (H) is calculated as follows:

H = 60 * (R - G) / (V - m) + 240
If all three values are equal, then Hue cannot be calculated.

HSV to RGB

Here’s how the formula works:

The formula first calculates the Chroma © of the color by multiplying the Value (V) and Saturation (S) values.

Next, it calculates the intermediate value X using the formula X = C * (1 - abs((H / 60) % 2 - 1)).

Then, it calculates the Value offset (m) using the formula m = V - C.

Finally, it calculates the Red ®, Green (G), and Blue (B) values using a series of conditional statements based on the Hue (H) value.
