#How to use:
This project is a wifi controlled car based on ESP8266 using micropython. It can be controlled by any device with a web browser. 
When the user connects with The ESP they can enter any ip address in the browser to open the car's web page and control the car.
multiple cars can be made and used together for racing or group games.

#Code explanation:
The code sets up an ESP8266-based access point (AP) and web server that allows remote control of a motorized vehicle. The web server serves a simple HTML page with four directional buttons that send HTTP GET requests to the ESP8266. The code listens for incoming connections on port 80 and responds to requests with the appropriate motor control commands.

The motor driver is set up with four pins, two for each motor. The pins are toggled on and off to control the direction of the motors. The move_forward(), move_backward(), move_left(), and move_right() functions control the direction of the motors by setting the appropriate pin values. The stop() function sets all motor pins to 0 to stop the vehicle.

The code uses the Python socket library to listen for incoming connections and the network library to set up the access point. The code also uses the machine library to control the motor driver pins.

Overall, this code serves as a simple example of using the ESP8266 as a web server to remotely control a device.
